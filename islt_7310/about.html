    My first Personal Coding Buddy Comment: 
    "Hello, everyone! For those who don’t know me, my name is Hosanna Tesfaye and I’m a 
    senior majoring in IT at Mizzou! I’m looking forward to working with you!"
    So do we just ask a question in the HTML comments for others to answer and then send back to the sender?

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>

        
        <p>
            I am an Information Technology undergraduate senior studying at <em>Mizzou University</em> to earn my Bachelor of Science in the College of 
            Engineering, along with a certificate in Media Design and Technology, Information Systems, and Cybersecurity. 
            My anticipated graduation date for my undergraduate studies is in <b>December 2022</b>. Once I earn my Bachelor’s Degree, 
            I plan to enroll in graduate school and earn a Master's in Information Technology with an emphasis in Cybersecurity. 
            My aim is to work in computer network analysis <em>or</em> network administration, which are subfields of Cybersecurity.</p>
