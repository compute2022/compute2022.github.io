        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Hosanna Tesfaye, and I am an aspiring female African-American engineer. I was born in St.Louis, Missouri where I 
        grew up for the first two years of my life before I moved to Jefferson City, Missouri was was raised for the morjity of my childhood.
        Creating and stylizing websites fascinates me, as websites are integral resources of the Web that we utilize whenever we search for something on the web. 
        I also have a creative side and love making art, whether visual, graphic, or musical. My hobbies include playing the piano, 
        flute, singing, and solving puzzles. I love to sit down and analyze all the puzzle pieces before I assemble the entire image piece by piece. 
        The feeling of completing the puzzle never fails to satisfy me.
