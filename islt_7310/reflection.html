        <p class="reflect_1">While it is true that I may not have the most traditional background in the emphasized field that I wish to make a 
            successful career in, I believe that each of those experiences were necessary for me to grow. In fact, it was 
            thanks to me participating in these experiences that I was able to work out of my comfort zone and find out what my
             future goals are.
        </p>
        <p id="indent1">
            If I learned anything from all of my work experiences, it's that there's always an opportunity to learn 
            if you are ready and willing to learning new things. Even if a job/project you take may not be to your fancy, or isn't 
            what you desire to continue doing, havng an open mind can help make the best of these experiences. Who knows, these experiences 
            could unexpectedly open doors for you. I believe that gaining any practical experience is better than having no experience.
        </p>
        <p id="indent2">I got to experience firsthand what an academic research environment was like and gained the tools 
             to conduct research on my own. I also got to experience firsthand what IT Support does and its responsibilities. 
             Each working opportunity gave me the chance to do hands-on work in each field, which gave me multiple skills that 
             I still apply to this day in my studies.</p>

        <p id="indent3">
            I can proudly say that my variety of experiences have helped me become a strong, well-rounded woman who isn't afraid 
            to go out of her comfort zone and experience the technology industry firsthand. If there is one trait I can boast it's my
            desire to satisfy my curiosity by learning new things.
