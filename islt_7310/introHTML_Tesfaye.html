     <p>Hello, my name is Hosanna Tesfaye and I am a senior majoring in Information Technology. 
         I will be graduating in December 2022 with my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology and 3 Undergraduate Certificates: Media Design and 
         Technology, Cybersecurity, and Information Systems. My goals for this course are to expand on my front-end web development skills, using HTML 
         and CSS3, that I learned from INFOTC_2830 (Web Application Development I). Creating and stylizing websites fascinates me, as websites 
         are integral resources of the Web that we utilize whenever we search for something on the web. I also have a creative side and love making art, 
         whether visual, graphic, or musical. My hobbies include playing the piano, flute, singing, and solving puzzles. I love to sit down and analyze 
         all the puzzle pieces before I assemble the entire image piece by piece. The feeling of completing the puzzle never fails to satisfy me.</p>
