            <p>
                In the summer of 2021, I, along with 9 other undergraduate students, were selected to partake in an annual Research Experiences
                for Undergraduates (REU) program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) called Consumer Networking Technologies.
                I participated in this 10-week program supported by NSF where I engaged, as part of an undergraduate research team, in a scientific research project 
                in which we evaluated Sleep Stage classification using Deep Learning. Our motivation was to provide an automatic, non-invasive, and more accessible 
                method of classifying sleep stages by gathering data from the hydraulic bed sensor and analyzing the data via a deep learning approach.

       <p> Abstract: Sleep stage classification can be used to monitor sleep quality and diagnose sleep disorders. 
Sleep disorders can be correlated to health conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This project 
uses a hydraulic bed sensor positioned under the mattress, as well as a deep learning approach, for sleep stage 
classification. Our motivation is to provide an automatic, non-invasive and more accessible method of classifying 
sleep stages by using deep learning to analyze data gathered from the hydraulic bed sensor. The test subjects for 
this project were elderly patients with sleep disorders. Polysomnography (PSG) data, the current gold standard, was 
also collected in a Sleep Lab to serve as the ground truth for the bed sensor data. In this study, sleep stages are 
categorized into 3 categories: Wake, Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM). This paper uses a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) hybrid model with 2 CNNs of different filter sizes 
for feature extraction. These features are then fed into the LSTM for classification. Our results show an average 
accuracy of about 75.5% using leave one subject out cross validation. These results are promising and show that the 
hydraulic bed sensor combined with a deep learning approach is capable of providing an automatic and non-invasive method 
of classifying sleep stages.
